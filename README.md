Implementation Example of In-Hand Object Rotation using the Allegro Hand V4

This repository provides an implementation example for in-hand object rotation using the **Allegro Hand V4**.  
It combines a ROS2-based hardware controller with an AI-driven manipulation algorithm originally developed for in-hand rotation research.

This codebase utilizes:
- **Allegro Hand ROS2 Controller**  
  https://github.com/Wonikrobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2
- **AI Algorithm: In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA)**
